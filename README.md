# Heart-Disease-Prediction-AI-Project
The program uses machine learning models to predict heart disease, providing a predictive framework for binary classification. This helps identify individuals at risk and prompts urgent action. Collaboration with healthcare practitioners and cardiovascular researchers is crucial for successful machine learning deployment.
## 🔍 Features
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Feature selection and engineering
- Model training using classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, KNN and Naive Bayes)
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix
